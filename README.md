## General Incident Response

- [PagerDuty Incident Response](https://response.pagerduty.com/)
  > This documentation covers parts of the PagerDuty Incident Response
  > process. It is a cut-down version of our internal documentation,
  > used at PagerDuty for any major incidents, and to prepare new
  > employees for on-call responsibilities. It provides information not
  > only on preparing for an incident, but also what to do during and
  > after. It is intended to be used by on-call practitioners and those
  > involved in an operational incident response process (or those
  > wishing to enact a formal incident response process).
