  > employees for on-call responsibilities. It provides information not
  > only on preparing for an incident, but also what to do during and
  > after. It is intended to be used by on-call practitioners and those
  > involved in an operational incident response process (or those
  > wishing to enact a formal incident response process).

## Computer Security Incident Response
